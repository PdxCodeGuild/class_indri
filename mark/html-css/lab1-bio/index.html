        Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt Jr.
    </h1>
    <h2>28th President of the United States</h2></div>
    <h3>1901–1909</h3>
    <p>
        Roosevelt assumed the presidency at age 42, and remains the youngest person to become president of the United States. As a leader of the progressive movement he championed his "Square Deal" domestic policies. It called for fairness for all citizens, breaking of bad trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. Roosevelt prioritized conservation and established national parks, forests, and monuments to preserve the nation's natural resources. 
        Polls of historians and political scientists rank him as one of the greatest presidents in American history.
