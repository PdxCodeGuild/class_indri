        <h1>Marjorie Lee Browne - Mathematician</h1>


    <p>Marjorie Lee Browne was a prominent mathematician and educator who, in 1949, became only the third African-American woman to earn a doctorate in her field.
   Browne was born on September 9, 1914, in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mary Taylor Lee and Lawrence Johnson Lee. Her father, a railway postal clerk remarried shortly 
   after his wife's death, when Browne was almost two years old. He and his second wife, Lottie, a school teacher, encouraged their daughter to take her studies seriously 
        as she was a gifted student. After receiving her bachelor's degree, she taught high school and college for a short term, including at Gilbert Academy in New Orleans.</p>

    <p> She then applied to the University of Michigan graduate program in mathematics. Michigan accepted African Americans, while many other US educational institutions did not at the time. 
    After working full-time at the historically black Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, and attending Michigan only during the summer, Browne's work paid off and she received a teaching 
    fellowship at Michigan, attending full-time and completing her dissertation in 1949. Her dissertation, "Studies of One Parameter Subgroups of Certain Topological and Matrix Groups," 
    was supervised by George Yuri Rainich.[2] She was one of the first African-American women in the US to earn a doctorate in mathematics, along with Evelyn Boyd Granville, 
    who also earned a Ph.D. in 1949.[1] Euphemia Haynes was the very first African-American woman in the US to earn a doctorate in mathematics, having earned hers in 1943.
