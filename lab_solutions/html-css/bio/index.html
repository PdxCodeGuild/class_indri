        The indri (/Àà…™ndri/ (Indri indri), also called the babakoto, is the
        largest living lemur, with a head-body length of about 64‚Äì72 cm (25‚Äì28+1‚ÅÑ2
        in) and a weight of between 6 and 9.5 kg (13 and 21 lb). It has a black
        and white coat and maintains an upright posture when climbing or clinging.
        It is monogamous and lives in small family groups, moving through the
        canopy, and is herbivorous, feeding mainly on leaves but also seeds,
        fruits, and flowers. The groups are quite vocal, communicating with other
        groups by singing, roaring and other vocalisations. Besides humans, it is
        the only mammal found that can use rhythm.

			It is a diurnal tree-dweller related to the sifakas and, like all lemurs,
			it is native to Madagascar. It is revered by the Malagasy people and plays
			an important part in their myths and legends with various stories in
			existence accounting for its origin. The main threats faced by the indri
			are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to slash and burn
			agriculture, fuelwood gathering, and logging. It is also hunted despite
			taboos against this. The International Union for Conservation of Nature
			has rated its conservation status as "critically endangered".
